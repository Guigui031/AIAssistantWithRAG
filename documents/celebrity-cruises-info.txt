The celebrity-cruises.csv file has for each line a cruise tarif offer based on cabins type. Each cruise has a sail date and a number of sail nights which is the duration of the cruise. The price is the group fare column where the advantage in price is shown in column Group Fare Advantage. For example, asking for a cruise in october, you need to filter on the sail date starting or ending in october.
